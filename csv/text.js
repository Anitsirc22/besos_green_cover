var text_right="The Bes√≤s River is a spanish river located in the province of Barcelona. It \n\ 
was considered one of the most polluted rivers in Europe in the last decades of the 20th\n\ 
entury as a result of the industries that were placed around it and the population\n\ 
increase that occurred at that time. From the construction of sewage plants along the \n\ 
river and the environmental recovery project of the final section of the river, \n\ 
many species of flora and fauna have been recovered.\n\ 
This is a research on the evolution of the green cover in the river mouth. \n\ 
Images with infrared band information provided by the\n\ 
ICGC have been analyzed to calculate the NDVI values over the period 2009-2016. \n\ 
It is important to consider that photometric flights have been carried out in different months \n\ 
of the year, for this reason a non-continuous growth of the vegetation can be appreciated."

var text_left="Raster images have been processed to classify all patterns of vegetation\n\ 
according to the ranges defined by the ICGC:"

//var range0="NDVI <0: Water or artificial covers"
var range1="0 < NDVI <0.2: Bare soil or dead vegetation"
var range2="0.2 < NDVI <0.4: Scattered or little vigorous vegetation"
var range3="0.4 < NDVI <0.6: Abundant and vigorous vegetation"
var range4="NDVI> 0.6: Very dense and vigorous vegetation"
